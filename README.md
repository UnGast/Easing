# Easing in Swift

## This project is composed of a stand-alone library of easing functions implemented in Swift 4 (Easing.swift)

### Type of supported functions

- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Quartic
- Quintic
- Sine
- Circular
- Exponential
- Elastic
- Back
- Bounce

Each type has its own separate *ease-In*, *ease-Out* and *ease-In-Out* form.

The functions are design to accept a generic floating-point value as time parameter,
and return a floating-point denoting the rate of change of a property over time.

Supported argument types:

- Float
- Double
- CGFloat

### Usage

Add the file *Easing.swift* to your project and you are ready to go.
The *Curve* type allows access to all the different functions, for example:

    let x: Float = 0.3
    let a = Curve.quadratic.easeIn(x)
    // a = 0.09

    let x2: CGFloat = 0.5
    let b = Curve.sine.easeOut(x2)
    // b = 0.7071067811865

Here's an example of the use of the elastic ease-in-out function in an array of 75 points in the [0, 1] interval.
